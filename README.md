<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BharatsDruv/ShareTheMeal/master/flutter_03.png" alt="Logo" width="1080/200" height="1920/200">

It is a cross platform mobile application build to bridge the gap between the providers who can donate/share their things with the NGOs or needy ones who can access those shared resources easily. 
Need of the application:

Here's why:
* More than 78 million peoples in India are poor who are unable to satisfy their basic needs of food, clothes and shelter on the other hand there are many peoples who have these resources access who wants to donate but can't find a direct way to do so.
* According to the Food Waste Index Report 2021 published by the United Nations Environment Programme, 50 kg of food is thrown away per person every year in Indian homes, which can be used to feed any poor/needy person.
* Our one initiative can change the lives of many:smile:

Of course, this application is not market ready or a product. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
